            <h2>Motherhood As Disability</h2>
            <p>   The motherhood penalty predicts significant impacts on income for mothers (Budig, & England, 2001). Several explanations for this penalty exist in the literature surrounding it, but for the purposes of this essay I have decided to focus primarily on the gender ideology perspective and the effect of time in the workforce lost to child rearing responsibilities. Work experience lost due time invested in child rearing is thought to explain somewhere between nineteen and thirty-seven percent of the motherhood wage penalty (Anderson, Binder, & Krause, 2003.) At the same time women in general perform more of the work of raising children in heterosexual two parent families (Pew Research Center, 2020). This tendency is associated with burnout and negative mental health outcomes; that is to say attempts to both maintain a female-social role incorporating a homemaker identity and a career are not conducive to good work-life balance (Meeussen, & Van Laar, 2018). The economic penalties that motherhood and womanhood for that matter impose bears resemblance to that of disability in that both are negative predictors of employment and income size. Disability has been shown to incur a wage penalty of around 20 percent (Randolph, 2004), and in an essay published in the Minnesota Law Review Elizabeth F. Emens lays out the ways in which social disability generates admin of life, or unpaid secretarial work that is a part of everyday life (doing taxes, scheduling appointments, arranging transportation, etc.), that contributes to the economic disadvantage incurred by disability. In the same essay Emens also states that this admin of life responsibility often falls more heavily onto women than onto men in general, and not just for those with disability (Emens, 2021). Admin of life shines light into one of the ways disabiled people are made disabled through the responsibilities that social structures burden them with. <br />
                My hope in restating the work of these researchers is double-fold. At one time it is my intention with this essay to reflect on the difficulties of motherhood and at the same time compare them to that of people who experience disability. My aim in comparing the two is not to assume that motherhood, in its similarity in economic outcome to physical and mental disability, has some inherent quality in it that produces disability. Instead I propose that by comparing the size of and theorized causes of the negative economic outcomes of both diagnosed disability and motherhood I can legitimize viewing motherhood through the social model of disability. I cannot claim that the research I review proves that motherhood is a socially generated disability, nor is that my aim. I purely intend to generate interest in applying the social model to further discourse on the motherhood penalty. It is my belief that by incorporating motherhood, and maybe eventually parenthood and child rearing as a whole, into the social model of disability credibility can be given both to the understanding that disability is generated and that the motherhood penalty is not the result of lifestyle, choice, or some other individualistic notion that places responsibility for the motherhood penalty on the shoulders of mothers.<br />

        <h3>Research Review</h3>
            <p>
                Motherhood Penalty<br />
                    The wages of mothers was calculated to decrease by seven percent per child by Budig, & England (2001). Budig, & England also found that about thirty percent of this gap was explained by the aforementioned decrease in work experience that motherhood predicts. The remaining part of the wage gap was left unexplained though they believed that their research suggested that motherhood might decrease mothers’ productivity at work. Anderson, Binder, & Krause (2003) proposed that because mothers who achieve higher levels of education are expected to be employed in jobs in which individual effort is important but do not incur higher motherhood penalties, it is less likely that effort significantly impacts the motherhood penalty. Therefore, if decreased productivity is a partial cause of the motherhood penalty then it is likely not due to lower effort. One explanation is that lower productivity is caused by lower experience which is a result of the previously mentioned nineteen to thirty-seven percent caused by work experience gaps. Though it is also possible that the increased pressure on mothers to take charge of child rearing generates stress that may lower productivity (Meeussen, & Van Laar, 2018). This would follow from the gender ideology perspective. Aassve, Fuochi, & Mencarini (2014) further support gender ideology in their finding that when women have higher income than their male partners they still end up doing more housework. This is all to say that mothers tend to be unequally responsible for the labor of child rearing and as such their income is negatively impacted in ways that fathers’ incomes are not. It is clear that the motherhood penalty is in part incurred because mothers are expected to perform this labor and are not compensated for said labor. Budig, & England (2001) say as much in their paper on the motherhood penalty. This labor necessitates time and as a result conflicts with labor in the workforce, in part due to a lack of schedule flexibility which is especially relevant to medium-educated (high-school) mothers (Anderson, Binder, & Krause, 2003).<br />
                Economic Impacts of Disability and Admin of Life<br />
                    Randolph (2004) reports a mean earnings difference between people with disability and people without as $7,643, ($31,405 for people without disabilities, $23,402 for people with disability). This is a disability penalty of twenty-five percent for mean earnings. In the literature review Randolph found a similar twenty percent income gap between people with disability and those without. In comparison with mothers and nonmothers, disability predicts significantly more for unemployment and predicts around twice as large of an income gap. Interestingly, the disability income penalty had a heavier effect on women than on men. Men with non-severe disabilities were reported to make significantly more money than women with non-severe disabilities (Randolph, 2004). Unfortunately, no cause of this disability penalty is provided, only evidence of the penalty. Perhaps this lies in the assumption that disability would reasonably limit effectiveness at work. However, that is refuted by this paper by the presence of a disability penalty for those without severe disability and the knowledge that with accommodation those with disability are able to be competitive in work with those without disability.<br />
                    Looking at Emens' essay in the Minnesota Law Review the concept of admin of life may be a helpful route to explain some of the disability income penalty. One way in which admin of life is proposed to have a more severe effect on those with disability is through medical admin, that is the time spent scheduling, commuting, and receiving medical treatment. The American Time Use Survey reported that the total opportunity cost of this type of admin for all Americans, not just those with disability, was $54 billion dollars annually (Emens, 2021). It would be expected that because people with disability both more often require medical care and have more difficulty arranging for transport that more of this opportunity cost would fall onto them. However, Emens would not attribute all the medical admin of those with disabilities face to simply a part of having an impairment. Rather, the social structures in the United States are made with an optimal person in mind, not someone with an impairment, and this structuring schema produces the disability. After all, if public transportation was more readily available to those with disability they would not have to spend as much time securing said transport to medical visits either crucial to their health or crucial to their eligibility for accommodations and benefits. There is also the matter of benefits admin, or the work of obtaining those benefits and accommodations. Which can be a long and slow process. As one veteran puts it, “My adult life has been consumed trying to battle the bureaucracy.” (Emens, 2021) <br />

        <h3>The Social Model of Disability</h3>
            <p>
                    The social model of disability originated in the work of Michael Oliver who would describe the social model as a tool to engage with the societal impact on disability. The primary benefit being that through the social model one can identify disabling barriers in the way society is organized. In identifying those issues they can be addressed and resolved. While there is still value in addressing and attempting to alleviate the effects of impairment it would perhaps serve better to have the social model stand at the forefront of how we move to improve the lives of those with disability (Oliver, 2013).<br />
                    In the essay titled, “The Need to Reimagine Disability Rights Law Because the Medical Model of Disability Fails Us All.”, Dr. Guevara explains that we are all vulnerable. The condition of our lives is volatile, something Guevara says the COVID19 pandemic makes clear. However, in the traditional medical model or individual model, we organize our society around an ideal or optimal way of being. Just as importantly this places the responsibility of disability on the shoulders of those with disability, not on the society which sets the standard for how people “should” be (Guevara, 2021). In this way the social model has similarities to Critical Race Theory, which through a legal context allows us to find fault in the systems which are responsible for racial disparities present in the United States. Critical Race Theory says that these disparities are not caused by racist individuals but are systemic. This is not lost on Guevara who incorporates Critical Race Theory into her essay. The core of the social model is in the question of whether a person should be altered to suit the environment or if the environment we produce should be one that is suitable and accessible to all people (Guevara, 2021). Acts like the ADA, while having been influenced by the social model, still place much of the responsibility of pursuing changes in social structure on those that are disabled and give tools to those who wish to avoid that change (Guevara, 2021; Emens, 2021).<br />

        <h3>Research Critique</h3>
            <p>
                I must acknowledge that this paper has many shortcomings that are significant. Firstly, this is not a comprehensive review of the literature. Due to both time constraints and inexperience I cannot provide a perspective that is representative of the most current and modern data. There are likely concepts that I have neglected to mention that could strengthen my argument and research that both supports and opposes my argument which I am not privy to. Particular weaknesses of the research I have reviewed is varied. Randolph (2004) as mentioned before, fails to give an explanation for why disability, even non-severe disability, predicts lower income. As such I rely on a legal article to find an explanation for some of the economic disadvantages incurred by disability. I do not doubt the credibility of the source, but understand that any conclusions drawn from it do not necessarily possess the same strength as one that could be drawn from more scientifically oriented data. The core flaw of this paper is that while it functions as a research paper the key point is not a direct result of the research. It is clear from the literature reviewed that there is a motherhood penalty and that this penalty is in part a result of a societal expectation that mothers will take the lead in caring for children. That conclusion is supported by the research. The conclusion I give in the next section is still an application of the research, but it is not as strong a conclusion as the one above due to the limitations of this paper. Regardless, I do not think that this paper fails in its original purpose.<br />
                Motherhood as Disability<br />
                    Thus far I have reviewed research that attributes negative economic outcomes that come with the time investment associated with motherhood and disability. Whether it be from lost work experience or stress and burnout that comes with being expected to both care for children and perform well in work, time is a crucial part of the motherhood penalty (Budig, & England, 2001; Anderson et. al., 2003; Meeussen, & Van Laar). The impact of disability on income is similarly significant to the impact of being female and having children (Randolph, 2004). Part of the economic cost of disability arises from admin of life, which women are more likely to be impacted by (Emens, 2021). The social model provides a framework by which we focus not on the individual but instead on the socially constructed environment that creates their circumstances, and this framework has long been a part of the disabled peoples’ movement (Oliver 2013). However, legal action taken with the social model have had inconsistent results, this may have been the result of the deep influence the individual model has and the stubborn persistence of making the negative outcomes of peoples’ lives their responsibility and not the responsibility of the society at large which may have produced those outcomes (Guevara, 2021). If societal structures are responsible for the time sink that motherhood proves to be, then using the social model could provide an avenue for understanding the motherhood penalty. The core concept of the social model is already present in some explanations of the motherhood penalty. For example, the increased impact of the motherhood penalty on medium-educated mothers may reflect the fact that jobs available to them often have inflexible schedules (Anderson et. al. 2003). This presence of inflexible schedules in a way acts like stairs where we need ramps. Society has organized itself in such a way that a new disability is created. Certain jobs are made inaccessible by their structure alone. The question arises, why are we organized in this way? Could we not simply reorganize so that this problem does not exist. Consider again that women more often do the work of child rearing due in part to social expectations, or gender ideology theory (Aassve et. al. 2014), why do we not simply redistribute this labor? Sweden did such radical reorganization in their introduction of paid parental leave and daddy quotas and they have been repeatedly measured to have low gender disparity (Bosson, Buckner, & Vandello, 2021).<br />
                    The social model clearly and effectively points us to reorganizing as a solution. If we consider motherhood to be a socially generated disability we come from the understanding that the motherhood penalty is a result of our structure and therefore if we change that structure we should be able to eliminate the motherhood penalty. And where explanatory theories that point to social causes fail to judge these social causes to be disabling, because child rearing is a choice after all, the social model recognizes that this structure is not a given or necessary. Sadly, this means that new research must be generated to test the validity of the social model with regards to the motherhood penalty. But if it proves to be an effective model then it will come with a benefit that other explanations don’t—a general solution. Therefore further research is justified. I hope that in expanding the scope of the social model that benefits may come to people with disabilities as well. That is to say if even child rearing can become a disability then the notion that disability means not normal becomes obviously wrong. Taking the social model to motherhood seems a natural progression of the concept and a useful progression too.<br />
